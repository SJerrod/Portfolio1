      <h2 class="card-title">About me</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Having moved so many times its hard to really define where im from. I will however say that I most recently hailed from <span class="bg-warning">Florida</span> where I attended Highschool. After highschool I attended <span class="bg-primary">The Citadel</span>, military college of South Carolina. What brought me to <span class="bg-success">Epicodus</span> was my overall desire to create games for everyone to enjoy. The prospect of taking my ideas from concept to actual product is exciting and i feel it grows closer each day I code. I look forward to what my future holds in the field of development</p>
