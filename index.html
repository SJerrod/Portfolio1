      <p class="card-text"><img src="css/images/jerrod1.jpg" alt="A rather dashing photo of Jerrod">Having moved so many times its hard to really define where im from. I will however say that I most recently hailed from <span class="bg-warning">Florida</span><img class="florida" src="css/images/sarasota.jpeg"> where I attended Highschool. After highschool I attended <span class="bg-primary">The Citadel</span><img class="citadel" src="css/images/citadel.jpg">, military college of South Carolina. What brought me to <span class="bg-success">Epicodus</span><img class="epicodus" src="css/images/matrix.jpg"> was my overall desire to create games for everyone to enjoy. The prospect of taking my ideas from concept to actual product is exciting and I feel it grows closer each day I code. I look forward to what my future holds in the field of development and hope you enjoy the games to come.</p>
